## Key Challanges Faced

**First of all,** I enjoyed doing the project beacuse this was the first time I'm making a project which connects both frontend to an actual database, not any cloud storages like firebase but a real database and this was my first time using a backend server. Learning backend basics itself is a huge task for but for me the key challange is working or bmaking the backend work, since this was quite tricky figuring out the API endpoints and port numbers.

## Lesson Learnt

A very big and important lesson learnt during this mini-project is **patience** since it played and still plays a crucial role in learning a new skill or going any work. It might me boring or even it might be overwhelming but one should trust the process. **Keep calm and cary on** is my go to quote, Because when I saw the deadline I trembled beacuse of my tight schedule(Internals and Semester exams) but I just trusted the flow and the process.

## Key Challanges Faced

**First of all,** I ejoyed doing the project beacuse this was the first time I'm making a project which connects both frontend to an actual database, not any cloud storages like firebase but a real database and this was my first time using a backend server. Learning itsself is a huge task for but for me the key challange is working in backend, since this was quite tricky figuring out the API and figuring out what has to be done first.

## Lesson Learnt

A very big and important lesson learnt during this mini-project is **patience** since it plays a crucial role in learning a new skill. It might me boring or even it might be overwhelming one should trust the process. **Keep calm and cary on** is my motivation or inspiration or whatever you call it, Because when I saw the deadline, is very small to complete while learing so I just said to my self **keep calm and cary on" .
